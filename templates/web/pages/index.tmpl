			<h2>So what else?</h2>
			<p>BoilerMake offers a number of perks to make an amazing weekend. To get the weekend started, we provide busses to a number of schools to make travelling a no-brainer. In the past, weâ€™ve sent buses to UIUC, UMich, and others.</p>
			<p>When you arrive, you will be given a swag bag that usually includes a t-shirt, a watter bottle, and stickers. Each year we have some special swag. BoilerMake 5 saw a fidget spinner. BoilerMake 2 saw a custom designed dev board.</p>
			<p>Throughout the weekend, we provide amazing catered meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We also have an all you can drink coffee, latte, etc. bar and snacks passed out during the event.</p>
			<p>At the end we have an awards ceremony where over $10,000 in prizes are given out. Last year winning teams received DJI Phantoms or Nintendo Switches. In addition to BoilerMake prizes, sponsors also usually have prizes for their categories.</p>
