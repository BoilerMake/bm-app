				<p>BoilerMake offers a number of perks to make an amazing weekend. To get the weekend started, we provide buses to a number of schools to make travelling a no-brainer. In the past, weâ€™ve sent buses to UIUC, UMich, and other universities.</p>
				<p>When you arrive, you will be given a swag bag that usually includes a t-shirt, a water bottle, and stickers. Each year we have some special swag. BoilerMake V saw fidget spinners, and BoilerMake II saw custom-designed dev boards.</p>
				<p>Throughout the weekend, we provide amazing catered meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We also have an all-you-can-drink coffee bar, and snacks are passed out during the event.</p>
				<p>At the end of the event, we have an awards ceremony where over $10,000 in prizes are given out. Last year, winning teams received DJI Phantom drones and Nintendo Switches. In addition to BoilerMake prizes, sponsors usually give out their own prizes for their contest categories.</p>
