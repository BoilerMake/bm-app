				<p>This year, 24 students from Purdue University have come
					together to host an unforgettable hackathon. All the work that has gone into planning
					this event—everything from setting up the venue to the annoying emails that we berate
					your inboxes with—was accomplished by somebody just like you. </p>

				<p> <br> If this sort of stuff sounds like your thing, stay tuned for more updates!
					We’ll be looking for new people to help us throw another successful hackathon in
					2018! As always - if you have any questions, feel free to hit us up at team@boilermake.org! </p>

			<p>The first BoilerMake started as a group of students involved with
				Purdue Hackers created BoilerMake as an organization under the
				Undergraduate Student Board. The goal was to get students involved and
				throw a hackathon where everyone could come together and create. It
				was created to be a great way for students to interact informally with
				companies and proving their technical skills through development.
				There were around 400 attendees from 18 schools and about 30 companies
				all within the same space of Purdue’s gym.</p>

			<p>BM II was the year of the BoilerMake Badges - custom Arduino boards for hackers to have fun with.
				Our venue changed to the Lambert Fieldhouse to accommodate the 500 hackers. We kept this
				number as the maximum to ensure that all the hackers and sponsors could fit into the same
				large room to interact and develop in.</p>
