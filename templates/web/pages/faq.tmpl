							<strong>What is a hackathon?</strong>
							<br></br>
    							A hackathon is not somewhere that you come to hack the NSA, 
							but rather a great place for people to come together and work 
							on incredible projects. You'll be surrounded by a group of 
							incredibly intelligent and creative people, as well as brilliant 
							mentors from some of the largest tech companies across the country. 
							Hackathons can serve as a great place to learn, and you may end up 
							surprising yourself on what you can accomplish by the end of the weekend.

							<strong>Are you an MLH member event?</strong>
							<br></br>
    							Yes! We are an MLH member and all hackers are required to sign the MLH Code of Conduct

								details about yourself on our application page.

						<div class="tile is-child box">

									<strong>How do I get there?</strong>
								</summary>
								If your college has a large group of people and is within a reasonable distance of 
								  Purdue University, we may be able to provide a bus to transport you to Purdue. If 
								  transportation is going to be an issue, please contact us at <a href='mailto:team@boilermake.org'>team@boilermake.org</a> 
								  and we'll try to figure something out.  We're crossing our fingers Elon comes up with the hyperloop, 
								  so we can get a lot more of you here.

						<div class="tile is-child box">
							<strong>Are there travel reimbursements?</strong>
							<br></br>

								bag and an extra change of clothes.

							<strong>Am I allowed to sleep?</strong>
							<br></br>
								Of course - in fact we encourage it!  We will provide air mattresses and comforters
								for you to take a break from hacking. However, if you're too busy to partake in such 
								activities, we'll make sure you have enough caffeine to keep going.
						</div>
						<div class="tile is-child box">
							<strong>Can I work with other people?</strong>
							<br></br>
								A maximum of 4 people can be on a team.  But you don't have to work with other 
								people if you enjoy working solo. Don't have a team? Don't worry - we'll have 
								sessions to help you form one!
						</div>
						<div class="tile is-child box">
							<strong>Can I use code that I have written before the event?</strong>
							<br></br>
								We ask that you do not use any code that was written before the start of 
								BoilerMake to keep a fair and level playing field for all participants.

						<div class="tile is-child box">
							<strong>Will there be any hardware?</strong>
							<br></br>
								We will have a bunch of hardware available for hackers to borrow at the
