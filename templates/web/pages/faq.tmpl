									<strong>What is a hackathon?</strong>
								</summary>
    							A hackathon is not somewhere that you come to hack the NSA, 
							but rather a great place for people to come together and work 
							on incredible projects. You'll be surrounded by a group of 
							incredibly intelligent and creative people, as well as brilliant 
							mentors from some of the largest tech companies across the country. 
							Hackathons can serve as a great place to learn, and you may end up 
							surprising yourself on what you can accomplish by the end of the weekend.
